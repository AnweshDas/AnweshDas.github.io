## About

I would only write about me that I am a simple guy with very high ambitions.Although I may not be a prodigal son but I have believed that with my hard work, sheer will and determination I can match any geniuses of the world. 
.I am an engineer with inclination towards leaning the world of Finance and Business administration.Thus I have decided to follow my dream to work in the world with both engineering and business model approach.
Thus creating Products rather than just Project.In my recent years I am into the field of Machine Learning and hope to pursue the lust for knowledge which has remained with me from my childhood.
